The University of Washington TriviaQA Dataset (version 1.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TriviaQA is a reading comprehension dataset containing over 650K question-answer-evidence triples. TriviaQA includes 95K question-answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering the questions. The details can be found in our paper

LIST OF DATA FILES
* qa/wikipedia-train.json, qa/web-train.json
* qa/[verified-]wikipedia-dev.json, qa/[verified-]web-dev.json
These files contain [verified] questions, answers, and document names in the train/dev set for the wikipedia/web domain. The details of the verified evaluation set are described in section 4 (evidence analysis) of the paper. The wikipedia/web documents are listed in the json array "EntityPages"/"SearchResults" for each question. The "Filename" field in each element of the array indicates the relative path of the file inside the wikipedia/web directory in evidence.

* qa/wikipedia-test-without-answers.json, qa/web-test-without-answers.json
These files contain questions and document names (no answers) in the train/dev set for the wikipedia/web domain. We are withholding the test answers for a later release. Please check the website -- http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/ -- for details of the test evaluation. 

* evidence/web, evidence/wikipedia
These directories contain documents in the train/dev/test set for the wikipedia/web domain. The documents are referenced in the json array "EntityPages"/"SearchResults" for each question in the QA pair files. The "Filename" field in each element of the array indicates the relative path of the file inside the wikipedia/web directory.
